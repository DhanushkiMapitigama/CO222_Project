and the program gives an output (word or character frequencies) as a horizontal bar
chart printed on the terminal.

File name/ File Names..........

The program should be able to accept any number of file names in any order.

Number of rows in the chart...........

The argument specifies the number of rows in the bar chart. It should be given as -l 10 where 10 is
the limit. It can be any positive integer. A number should always follow the -l argument. The pair
can be in any place of the arguments list.

When –scaled argument is given, the first row of the graph should fully occupy the max print width.
Any other row should scale to be matched with first row scale factor.

given as words, the -w should be given whereas -c argument will give character frequency output
